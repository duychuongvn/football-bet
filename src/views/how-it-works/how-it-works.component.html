        <v-card-text>
          <p>All matches will be managed by smart contracts thanks to the evolution of the Blockchain in general and the
            Ethereum in specific. A match goes through the following phases:</p>
          <ul class="mb-0">
            <li class="mb-3">
              <strong>Open</strong>: The open opens 1 week before the match starts. You can bet on either team as often you
              want with as much Ether as you want. The minimum bet amount is 0.001 Ether, which is about 50 cents right now.</li>
            <li class="mb-3">
              <strong>Closed/Match playing</strong>: The bet closes 15 mins before the match starts. It is too late to place
              bets now, as the match is starting soon.</li>
            <li class="mb-3">
              <strong>Match finished</strong>: When the regular match tie is over (90’), the match result goes through 2
              stages confirmation, one for the API result fetching and one from the Admin. The fetching and confirmation
              of the match outcome have to be completed within 1 day from after the match starts. If it takes longer, you
              can claim refunds.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Payouts</strong>: Once the winner is fetched and confirmed, there is no go-back. Users, who betted
              on the winning team will receive their payouts with 5% juice cut (We believe we are offering the lowest juice
              in comparison with other betting systems). In case there are no winning sides, refunds will be sent out to
              bettors with 2,5% juice cut each side.</li>
          </ul>
