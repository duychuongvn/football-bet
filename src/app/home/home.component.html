          <p>Bet Ether on your favorite teams (or draw result) for every match of the FIFA World Cup 2018 in Russia.</p>
          <p>All matches will be managed by smart contacts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. By calling its functions you can bet on either team competing in a match. After the match is decided, the payout will be sent out to the people who betted correctly.</p>
          <p>Other than betting on the wrong team, there is no way of losing Ether. The design of the deployed Bet smart contracts makes this betting dApp (distributed application) fraud- and tamper-proof! Your bets are safely stored in the smart contracts. In case of worst scenarios (match is postponed, external data provider misbehaves, etc), you are always able to get all your Ether back without paying any fee!</p>

        <div class="card-header font-weight-bold">HOW IT WORKS</div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>All matches will be managed by smart contracts thanks to the evolution of the Blockchain in general and the Ethereum in specific. A match goes through the following phases:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Open</strong>: The open opens 1 week before the match starts. You can bet on either team as often you want with as much Ether as you want. The minimum bet amount is 0.001 Ether, which is about 50 cents right now.</li>
            <li><strong>Closed/Match playing</strong>: The bet closes 15 mins before the match starts. It is too late to place bets now, as the match is starting soon.</li>
            <li><strong>Match finished</strong>: When the regular match tie is over (90â€™), the match result goes through 2 stages confirmation, one for the API result fetching and one from the Admin. The fetching and confirmation of the match outcome have to be completed within 1 day from after the match starts. If it takes longer, you can claim refunds.</li>
            <li><strong>Payouts</strong>: Once the winner is fetched and confirmed, there is no go-back. Users, who betted on the winning team will receive their payouts with 5% juice cut (We believe we are offering the lowest juice in comparison with other betting systems). In case there are no winning sides, refunds will be sent out to bettors with 2,5% juice cut each side.</li>
          </ul>
